### Introduction

This project was created as part of a datathon to explore and present insights from large datasets. The goal was to apply data visualization techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data. The project demonstrates the power of simple tools like Excel in handling and visualizing large datasets effectively.

### Datasets
The datasets used in this project were sourced from Kaggle, covering a range of topics. The datasets include:

global gender gap report
Gender Equality Data
women at work
Female inequality

Each dataset was carefully selected to ensure relevance and richness in content for analysis.

### Methodology
The process involved several steps:

  - Data Collection: Large datasets were downloaded from Kaggle.
  - Data Cleaning: Basic data cleaning was performed using Excel to handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
  - Data Analysis: Initial data exploration and analysis were conducted using Excel's built-in functions.
  - Data Visualization: Various Excel features such as pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting were utilized to create meaningful visualizations.

### Results
The visualizations revealed several interesting insights, including:

  - Insight 1
  - Insight 2
  - Insight 3
These findings can help in making data-driven decisions and further exploration of the datasets.

### How to Use
To explore the visualizations and analysis:

Clone this repository.
Open the provided Excel files in the visualizations folder.
Navigate through the sheets to view the data and visualizations.
Feel free to modify the Excel files or use the datasets for your own analysis.
